<h1>STABILITY</h1>

<p>In the atmosphere, there is a something called a lapse rate. We already looked what happens to the 
temperature vs. altitude in the temperature section of prerequisites. It should decrease as we get higher.
But there are variations to this specific pattern, and the average profile of temperature vs altitude 
under dry conditions is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR). Adiabatic means that no heat is 
transferred to or from the system and surroundings. The DALR is found to be about -10 degrees Celsius/km. 
A derivation is given in the advanced section, if you know calculus. If you don't, just ignore the 
derivation and take the DALR to be -10 degrees Celsius/km.</p>

<p>Of course, the atmosphere isn't always dry, so we have to measure something called the moist 
adiabatic lapse rate (MALR). The MALR does vary! For our purposes, we will use 
-6 degrees Celsius/km for the MALR, which is a general good number to use.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about stability. Take a look  at the image below, where ELR stands for environmental
lapse rate, or the lapse rate which is observed in the current environment:</p>

</div>
<div id="gallery">
<img src = "images/stable.png" />
</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>Here, the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius at the surface and 0 degrees celsius at 3,000 m (3 km). So,
the lapse rate observed or ELR is (T stands for temperature in Celsius, z stands for altitude in km): 
$ELR = \frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{z_{2}-z_{1}} = \frac{30 - 20}{0 - 3} = 
	-3.33...^{o}C/km$</p>
	
<p>The magnitude of the value 3.33 Celsius/km is smaller than the DALR's magnitude value of 10 degrees
Celsius/km. So seeing the ELR > DALR, the atmosphere is stable. This would be the same case when comparing 
to the moist adiabatic lapse rate, since the magnitude of the value 3.33 Celsius/km is smaller than 
the MALR's magnitude value of 6.5 Celsius/km.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at some unstable atmospheres.</p>

</div>

<div id="gallery">
<img src = "images/unstable.png" />
</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>Let us pretend that both these two pictures are 0 degrees Celsius at 2000 m (2 km) and 30 degrees Celsius 
at the surface. Then:</p>

<p>$ELR = \frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{z_{2}-z_{1}} = \frac{30 - 0}{0 - 2} = 
	-15^{o}C/km$</p>
	
<p>The magnitude value of -15 degrees Celsius/km is greater than either the magnitudes of 10  (
the DALR) or 6 (MALR). Therefore, since this ELR value is greater than the DALR and MALR values,
the atmosphere is unstable. </p>

<p>One final note: You always compare the slopes. Sometimes you can have a tricky scenario like this:</p>

<img src="images/weird.png" />

<p>Follow the black diagonal line (the ELR) to the red line (DALR). The black line then goes in the same direction
as the red line (DALR) at the DALR. It turns out, that the DALR from the surface until it meets the red line 
is stable (an "inversion") occurs. When the ELR = DALR, this is a situation known as a neutrally stable 
situation.</p>

<p>EXPLORATION: Look up the following inversions: marine inversion, subsidence inversion, and 
radiation inversion. How does each form?</p>

<h2>SMOKESTACK MIXING</h2>

<p>Different atmospheric stabilites lead to different results for a smokestack. For one, if the 
ELR = DALR, the smokestack spreads vertically and creates a cone. If the ELR > DALR, then the 
plume from the smokestack spreads horizontally from the top of the stack. From a bird eye's view,
the top view looks like a fan. If the ELR = DALR, then suddenly for some reason becomes > DALR, 
an inversion occurs, and the air on top of the smokestack cannot move up. The air is cooler underneath
the smokestack than the air below, and we get the deadly "fumigator", which will give people a bad day.
If the ELR is generally < ELR, then the atmosphere is unstable and the smokestack becomes wavy. Finally,
if we have a profile like the on in our final note from above, we have the plume lofting. Variations of properties
of smokestack plumes are usually caused by winds, temperature, topography, and the details of the 
smokestack itself (like the height).</p>

<p>Usually when a temperature inversion occurs, the height of inversion is known as the "mixing" height,
where pollutants/gases "mix". This is an important point to remember for when you get to the Gaussian plume.</p>
