<h1>BASIC CHEMISTRY</h1>

<p>Before getting started, it is important to know some basic chemistry. For the purposes of this site, 
chemical nomenclature, or simply the naming of chemicals, will not be discussed in detail. Both full
chemical names and symbols will be given.</p>

<p>On this site, we abbreviate chemical names by using their formulas. For instance, carbon dioxide is 
CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen dioxide is NO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen is O<sub>2</sub>, etc. Names and their corresponding
symbols will always be given on this site.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to know what a mol is. The mol basically stands for 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> of something.
For instance, if I had a mol of marbles, I would have 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> marbles. We usually correlate 
mols with atoms and molecules, however. So helium is an individual atom - a mol of that is 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> 
atoms. But carbon dioxide is a molecule (atoms connected to each other), so a mol of 
carbon dioxide is 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules...of carbon dioxide. </p>

<p>Now let's look at a chemical equation:</p>

<p>(n1)A + (n2)B --> (n3)C + (n4)D</p>

<p>A and B stand for the reactants, your starting material; C and D stand for the end products of the reaction. 
It's quite simple to read, but much harder to investigate every aspect of it. n1, n2, n3, n4 stand for the 
number of atoms or molecules of each each reactant and product, respectively.</p>

<p>In chemistry we often use the Celsius or the Kelvin temperature scales. It is very rare that we use the Farenheit scale. 
When you read weather reports in the United States, it will usually be in the Farenheit scale (there can a Celsius right next 
to the Farenheit number sometimes). We stick to the Celsius, because it helps to give us an easy conversion 
to Kelvin if we need it. You simply add 273 to the Celsius number to get the Kelvin number, and you subtract 
273 from the Kelvin number to get the Celsius number. For instance, let us say we had 20 degrees Celsius weather.
20 + 273 = 293; so the temperature in Kelvin is 293 Kelvin. If we had 300 Kelvin weather, we subtract: 300 - 273 = 
27 degrees Celsius weather, so that's the weather in Celsius.</p>

<p>One good thing to know is balancing equations. It is not necessary to know this skill on the site, however, 
it is an imperative skill in general chemistry. While you don't need to know balancing equations on this website,
I would recommend you up how to balance equations and try a few problems when you have time.</p>


<p>What we do need to know, however, is something called mixing ratios. Mixing ratios usually are a measurement
of concentration - measured in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt).
However, chemists usually like to measure concentrations in molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> or mols/liter. So as you can
see, we will need to find how to interconvert between these two. The important conversion for atmospheric chemistry
is from molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> to ppm, ppb or ppt and vice versa. This conversion is a little more tricky
because we need to use something called the ideal gas law.</p>

<p>Pressure x Volume = (number of moles of some chemical) * (R which is a constant) * (Temperature in Kelvin)....or</p>

<p>PV = nRT <--- THE IDEAL GAS LAW</p>

<p>It is important to see that units are consistent: you should have the same units on both sides of the equation.
R is called the ideal gas constant, which is 0.082 (liters x atm)/(mole x Kelvin).</p>

<p>Again, the conversion is a little tricky. We should work through an example. Let's start with converting
molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> to ppm, ppb, and ppt.</p>

<hr />

<p>EXAMPLE FOR CONVERTING MOLECULES/CM<sup>3</sup> TO PPM/PPB/PPT:</p>

<p>Let us say we have a 2.1 x 10<sup>12</sup> (molecules ozone)/(cm<sup>3</sup>) in Denver. The air pressure in 
Denver is about 0.70 atmospheres (atm). (Atmospheres are units of pressure). Calcualte the mixing ratio in ppm,
ppb, and ppt. Assume the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. </p>

<p>1. FIND THE GENERAL CONCENTRATION OF AIR IN MOLECULES/CM<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Let's rearrange some the ideal gas law:</p>

<p>PV = nRT</p>
<p>$\frac{PV}{RT} = n$ We divide both sides by R and T.</p>
<p>$\frac{P}{RT} = \frac{n}{V}$ We divide both sides by V.</p>

<p>n/V is our concentration of air. Now we need to find this concentration using the ideal gas law. Remember our temperature conversion:
25 degrees Celsius + 273 = 298 K.</p>

<p>$\frac{(0.7 atm)}{(\frac{0.082 L \cdot atm}{mol \cdot K})(298 K)} = \frac{n}{V}$</p>

<p>When you calculate the left side of the equation, you should get 0.0286 mols/L. However, it would be more convienient to 
have it in molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>. There are 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules in 1 mol, so we can do conversion here.</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{0.029\:mol}{L}\right)\left(\frac{6.02 \cdot 10^{23}molecules}{1\:mol}\right) = 1.75 \cdot 10^{22} molecules/L$</p>

<p>Also, there are 1000 cm<sup>3</sup> in one liter, so we can do some more conversion:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{1.75 \cdot 10^{22} molecules}{L}\right)\left(\frac{1 L}{1000\:cm^{3}}\right) = 1.75 \cdot 10^{19} molecules/cm^{3}$</p>

<p>So the general air concentration is  1.75 x 10^{19} molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> at Denver at 0.7 atm and 25 degrees Celsius. </p>

<p>2. CONVERT TO MIXING RATIO.</p>

<p>If you've done dimensional anaylsis but are not used to mixing ratios, this may seem a little odd to you. If you haven't seen
any of this before, just follow along. ppm, ppb, and ppt are all different. So we'll calculate each:</p>

<p>ppm: The general form of conversion is </p>

<p>$\left(\frac{2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1\:cm^{3}\:air}{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}\right)(10^{6}molecules\:air) = 0.12\:ppm$</p>

<p>ppb: The general form of conversion is:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1\:cm^{3}\:air}{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}\right)(10^{9}molecules\:air) = 120\:ppb$</p>

<p>ppt: The general form of conversion is:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1\:cm^{3}\:air}{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}\right)(10^{12}molecules\:air) = 120000\:ppt$</p>

<p>Basically, we first find the general air concentration. Then we find the inverse of it,  multiply that by our chemical 
concentration that we are trying to convert (the one that the question gives us), and finally multiply that whole thing 
by a factor (10<sup>6</sup> for ppm, 10<sup>9</sup> for ppb, and 10<sup>12</sup> for ppt).</p>

<p>DOING THE REVERSE:</p>

<p>We'll now do the reverse. What if they give us ppm/ppb/ppt and we want to convert to molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>? Well - let's
look at this example. </p>

<p>Let us say we have a 0.12 ppm (same as 120 ppb and 120000 ppt) (molecules ozone)/(cm<sup>3</sup>) in Denver. The air pressure in 
Denver is about 0.70 atmospheres (atm). (Atmospheres are units of pressure). Convert this 
mixing ratio to molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>. Assume the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. </p>

<p>1. FIND THE GENERAL CONCENTRATION OF AIR.</p>

<p>Same as step 1 in the previous section! Let's rearrange some the ideal gas law:</p>

<p>PV = nRT</p>
<p>$\frac{PV}{RT} = n$ We divide both sides by R and T.</p>
<p>$\frac{P}{RT} = \frac{n}{V}$ We divide both sides by V.</p>

<p>n/V is our concentration of air. Now we need to find this concentration using the ideal gas law. Remember our temperature conversion:
25 degrees Celsius + 273 = 298 K.</p>

<p>$\frac{(0.7 atm)}{(\frac{0.082 L \cdot atm}{mol \cdot K})(298 K)} = \frac{n}{V}$</p>

<p>When you calculate the left side of the equation, you should get 0.0286 mols/L. However, it would be more convienient to 
have it in molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>. There are 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules in 1 mol, so we can do conversion here.</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{0.029\:mol}{L}\right)\left(\frac{6.02 \cdot 10^{23}molecules}{1\:mol}\right) = 1.75 \cdot 10^{22} molecules/L$</p>

<p>Also, there are 1000 cm<sup>3</sup> in one liter, so we can do some more conversion:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{1.75 \cdot 10^{22} molecules}{L}\right)\left(\frac{1 L}{1000\:cm^{3}}\right) = 1.75 \cdot 10^{19} molecules/cm^{3}$</p>

<p>So the general air concentration is  1.75 x 10^{19} molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> at Denver at 0.7 atm and 25 degrees Celsius. </p>

<p>2. CONVERT THE MIXING RATIO.</p>

<p>The general form is:</p>

<p>For ppm:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{0.12\:ppm\:ozone}{10^{6}\:molecules\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right) = 2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone$
</p>

<p>For ppb:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{120\:ppb\:ozone}{10^{9}\:molecules\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right) = 2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone$</p>

<p>For ppt:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{120000\:ppt\:ozone}{10^{12}\:molecules\:air}\right)\left(\frac{1.75 \cdot 10^{19}\:molecules\:air}{1\:cm^{3}\:air}\right) = 2.1 \cdot 10^{12} molecules\:ozone$</p>

<p>The first step is exactly the same for converting both ways, the second step is a little different. Here we find the general
concentration of air, multiply that by the amount they give us, and divide by the factor (10<sup>6</sup> for ppm, 10<sup>9</sup>
for ppb...etc).</p>

<p>The calculations done in this example ONLY work for air pollutant concentrations. Do NOT use these for concentrations of pollutants 
in water!</p>
