<h1>SOME EVEN MORE CHEMISTRY</h1>

<h2>A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF RATES</h2>

<p>We will not spend too much time here, because, these topics will come again when we are working with 
actual air pollution problems. But still, this is a good preview of tool skills necessary for understanding
what in the world is going on when it comes to air pollution.</p>

<p>First, we need to understand rates. Rates of reaction, at the very basic level, show how fast reactions go.
Some reactions go very slow, like the ones that go in rocks to break them down. Others go quite fast, such as
the burning of paper.</p>

<p>To symbolize the rate of reaction, we write a rule for the chemical reaction. Rules are not the same for all 
chemical reactions. For instance, you may see a rule (called a rate law) like this:</p>

<p>Rate = k[Reactant 1][Reactant 2]</p>

<p>Or...like this....</p>

<p>Rate = k[Reactant 1]</p>

<p>...etc.</p>

<p>In the first case, there are two reactants reacting with each other to form products. In the second,
there is only one reactant going through some reaction to form product(s), possibly through light or other
means.</p>

<p>Another interesting to note is that k. This stands for the rate constant. For this site, the rate constant is 
measured in units of $\frac{cm^{3}}{molecule\cdot s}$ while the reactant concentration is measured in units 
of molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>We are going be seeing a lot of this in the tropospheric and stratospheric tabs.</p>

<h2>A BRIEF LOOK AT EQUILIBRIUM </h2>

<p>I am not so good at defining chemical equilibrium. It is...basically, the situation where both
reactant and product concentrations do not change over time. For our reactions when we study 
acid rain, this concept will be utilized. When we talk about this kind of thing going on, 
we usually use special (rather odd) arrows.</p>

<p>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or in words: </p>

<p>Carbonic Acid ⇌ Hydrogen Ion + Bicarbonate Ion</p>

<p>We'll explore this in the acid rain portion, along with a chemical rule called Henry's Law.</p>

<h2>ENTHALPY/HEAT OF REACTION FOR GASEOUS REACTIONS</h2>

<p>Now, in this section we WILL have to do some practice and pull out a calculator.</p>

<p>We will just be incredibly basic here - this is an air pollution site and not a physical chemistry one, 
so I am greatly simplifying the understanding of enthalpy. Enthalpy is basically the "heat of reaction at constant pressure", and
is a way of symbolizing energy gained or released in a chemical reaction. Again - this is not totally 100% accurate,
but for basic understanding of air pollution, it's good enough. In our scenario, we call the situation when 
a system in a chemical reaction releases energy --- exothermic. The situation in which a chemical reaction "gains" energy
is called endothermic. We usually denote the enthalpy as ΔH. How do we know whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic? In air pollution, one good method 
(not 100% accurate but usually gets the job done) is using a very interesting mathematical formula. It is this:</p> 

<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup>=Σn<sub>products</sub>ΔH<sub>products</sub><sup>o</sup> - Σn<sub>reactants</sub>ΔH<sub>reactants</sub><sup>o</sup> (!!)</p>

<p>It's best to see an example on how this works. (If you've already taken general chemistry, this should be a piece of cake for you). </p>

<p>To use this formula for those of you who have no idea what this means, it means 1) to multiply the enthalpy of 
formation of each reactant by its number of molecules and 2) to multiply the enthalpy of formation of each
product by its number of molecules and third) subtract 1) from 2). Now some of you are thinking, "I have 
no idea what this guy just said." It's probably better to see an example. Let's take a look at this question.</p>

<hr />
<p>EXAMPLE 1:</p>
<p>The reaction OH + HNO<sub>3</sub> --> H<sub>2</sub>O + NO<sub>3</sub>
(in words; hydroxyl radical plus nitric acid yields water and nitrate radical) is a significant reaction which 
can help terminate the hydroxyl (OH) radical, which is largely responsible for advancing pollution in the air.
Calculate the enthalpy of the reaction. Is it exothermic or endothermic? Make an educated guess on if this 
reaction happens favorably in nature.</p>

<p>You need to know some information: ΔH<sub>f</sub> of OH is 37,280 J/mol, the ΔH<sub>f</sub> of HNO<sub>3</sub> is
-134,000 J/mol, ΔH<sub>f</sub> of H<sub>2</sub>O is -241,826 J/mol, and ΔH<sub>f</sub> of NO<sub>3</sub> is 73,700 J/mol.</p>

<p>So, from above, follow 1) and look at the reactants, calculate the reactant form of the equation-->(1)(37,280 J/mol) + 
(1)(-134,300 J/mol) = (-97,020 J/mol). 2) Look at the products and do the same thing: (1)(-241,826 J/mol) + (1)(73,000 J/mol)
= -168,126 J/mol. (3) Subtract 1) from 2) --> (-168,126 J/mol) - (-97,020 J/mol) = -71,106 J/mol.</p>

<p>Let's summarize the calculations.</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup>=Σn<sub>products</sub>ΔH<sub>products</sub><sup>o</sup> - Σn<sub>reactants</sub>ΔH<sub>reactants</sub><sup>o</sup></p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = (-241,826 J/mol + 73,700 J/mol) - (37,280 J/mol + (-134,300 J/mol))</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = (-168,126 J/mol) - (-97,020 J/mol)</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = -71,106 J/mol.</p>

<p>We usually asscoiate neagtive answers of this type of question with exothermicity. For much of air pollution,
it is usually safe to assume that exothermic reactions are favorable. WARNING!: This is the case for most of the 
famous basic air pollution reactions. This might NOT apply to all chemical reactions! For the reactions on this
site though, and in general air pollution chemistry, we can usually predict negative enthalpies of reaction 
are favorable in nature. Let's practice some more examples. (Chemistry majors and people who have taken general chemistry,
you know finding favorable reactions involves thermodynamic calculation of Gibbs free energy and other stuff, this website
will only go over enthalpy).</p>

<hr />


<p>EXAMPLE 2:</p>
<p>The reaction of the gases OH + SO<sub>2</sub> --> HSO<sub>3</sub> was thought to be an important component of the
formation of sulfuric acid rain. (Apparently, there's another reaction which is actually the main contributor 
to acid rain).</p>

<p>Information you need to know: enthalpy associated with OH: 37,280 J/mol, enthalpy associated with SO<sub>2</sub>:
-296,810 J/mol, and ethalpy asscoiated with HSO<sub>3</sub>: -373,000 J/mol.</p>

<p>Start with the usual:</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup>=Σn<sub>products</sub>ΔH<sub>products</sub><sup>o</sup> - Σn<sub>reactants</sub>ΔH<sub>reactants</sub><sup>o</sup></p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = (-373,000 J/mol) - (37,280 J/mol - (-296,810 J/mol))</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = (-373,000 J/mol) - (-259,530 J/mol)</p>
<p>ΔH<sub>reaction</sub><sup>o</sup> = -113,470 J/mol</p>

<p>The answer is negative, and the reaction is exothermic and favorable.</p>


<hr />
<h2>LIFETIMES</h2>

<p>When you hear the word "lifetime", this implies many different defintions. The definition we use on this 
site corresponds to the use of the word in air pollution chemistry. (In other fields, the use of the word
might mean a different thing). We will define lifetime the time it takes for chemical's concentration 
to decrease to 37% of its value. This seems like an odd defintion, but it is useful for air pollution studies. Lifetimes do not have one set specific formula for every chemical, but we will
deal a lot with the case of "psuedo-first order reactions" and "photolysis" reactions. </p>

<p>For an example, one we'll be using a lot is the formula (which we won't derive here) lifetimes
with reactions involving OH radicals:</p>

<p>$\tau_{other\:chemical} = \frac{1}{k_{OH +\:other\:chemical}[OH]}$ (!!)</p> 

<p>
This formula usually works for any chemical (as a gas) reacting with the OH radical by itself!</p>

<hr />

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<p>The  rate constant of the hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide is about $1\cdot 10^{-13} \frac{cm^{3}}{molecule \cdot s}$
Assume that the hydroxyl radical concentration is 1.23 x 10<sup>11</sup> molecules/cm<sup>3</sup>. Given this information,
calculate the lifetime of nitrogen dioxide.</p>

<p>$\tau = \frac{1}{k_{OH + some\:other\:chemical}[OH]}$</p> 

<p>$\tau = \frac{1}{1\cdot 10^{-13} \frac{cm^{3}}{molecule \cdot s}[1.23 \cdot 10^{11} \frac{molecules}{cm^{3}}]}$</p>

<p>The answer is about 0.80 seconds.</p>
