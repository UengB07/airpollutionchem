<h1>A VERY BRIEF LOOK AT INDOOR AIR POLLUTION</h1>

<p>When we talk about indoor pollution, we can talk about a couple of things that could affect your health.</p>

<p>SMOKING: Why are there so many laws that prohibit people from smoking indoors?</p>

<p>Smoking, an example of air pollution, is difficult to stop simply because people become addicted to it or/and it 
helps to relieve stress. Quitting smoking is often not easy, and usually becomes a challenge. But why is it dangerous?</p>

<p>There can be carcinogens (things that cause cancer) in cigarette smoke, one example is a group of compounds 
called polyaromatic hydrocarbons (or PAHs), these often have fancy names, such as benzopyrene and dibenzanthracene. 
When the combustion reaction of cigarette smoke is incomplete, carbon monoxide is formed. All these compounds 
can go into a person next to you if you are smoking.</p>

<p>Numerous health effects can occur because of smoking, such as strokes, and....well, lung cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer,
kidney cancer, cancer this, cancer that...maybe just cancer in general. </p>

<p>There are several sites online to investigate smoking (as well as several sites to help one quit smoking), but of course
it is no easy feat to quit, and smoking will not seem to go away any time soon. Be aware smoking is a part of air pollution. </p>

<p>Other pollutants include formaldehyde which is found in some foam insulation, and carbon monoxide or possibly NOx from some
heaters or fireplaces (usually these don't work properly for significant emission of pollutants). Found in old homes,
abestos is also a pollutant (these are pretty much tiny fibers that you can inhale but not really notice).</p>

<p>One particular area we should pay attention to is radioactivity. Did you know there's a lot of chemicals undergoing radioactive decay,
maybe underneath your feet or on the ground? Some elements undergo radioactive decay, and that in turn can form elements, like polonium, that 
seep into the house. (See the picture on the bottom of the page). This is usually due to the decay of uranium in rocks. </p>

<p>Be aware there are several indoor pollutants that may affect your home - radioactive decay from the earth which your home sits,
lead in the air, abestos, etc. If you live in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has something called
the IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) which gives information if you are concerned. </p>
