<h1>ACID RAIN (OR MORE ACCURATELY, ACID DEPOSITION)</h1>

<h2>Some Primers</h2>

<p>Before we can talk about acid rain, we have to get a few things out of the way first. First - we need to 
discuss pH.</p>

<p>pH stands for "potential of hydrogen", and is a measure to see how acidic (or basic; non-acidic) something 
is. Items with a pH less than 7.0 are considered acidic. Items with a pH greater than 7.0 are considered basic.
Items with a pH of 7.0 are neutral. pH is on a log scale - the formula for pH is:</p>

<p>pH = -log[H+]</p>

<p>What you need to calculate the pH is the H+ or hydrogen ion concentration. Then you get a calculator, take 
the negative log (hopefully you know how to do that on your calculator), and there's your pH. In the usual case
[H+] ions are usually measured in moles per liter, or molar (M). </p>

<hr />
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<p>Calculate the pH if you have 7 x 10<sup>-8</sup> hydrogen ions in a solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>pH = -log[H+]</li>
<li>pH = -log[7 x 10<sup>-8</sup>]</li>
<li>pH = -(-7.15)</li>
<li>pH = 7.15</li>
</ul>

<p>The pH is in between 7.1 and 7.2. It's greater than 7.0, so it's slightly basic.<p>

<p>Of course, it's good to do the reverse. How much [H+] is in a solution with a pH of 7.15?</p>
<ul>
<li>pH = -log[H+]</li>
<li>7.15 = -log[H+]</li>
<li>-7.15 = log[H+]</li>
<li>10<sup>-7.15</sup> = 10<sup>log[H+]</sup></li>
<li>7 x 10<sup>-8</sup> M = [H+]</li>
</ul>

<hr/ >

<p>Now, the second thing we need to discuss is the concept of chemical equilibrium. We briefly saw it in the More Basic 
Chemistry section in the prerequisites section. What we call equibrium constants contain important information 
about the reaction's equilibrium. An equilibrium constant is defined (in general) as the quotient of the 
product of the concentration of the products, each product having a power to the number of molecules involved, 
over the product of the concentration of the reactants, each reactant having a power to the number of 
molecules involved only when the system is in proper equilibrium, if it is not, then this is the quotient.</p>

<p>Wait, what? This may seem like a confusing definition, but it looks prettier mathwise. Consider the 
reaction aA + bB --> cC + dD. Then the equilibrium constant (only works if the 
system is in equilibrium) is (denoted by a K<sub>eq</sub>):</p>

<p>$K_{eq} = Products/Reactants =  \frac{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}$</p>

<p>If we had aA + bB --> cC it would be still products over reactants (also the corresponding number 
of molecules are the exponents)</p>

<p>$K_{eq} = Products/Reactants =  \frac{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}{[C]^{c}}$</p>

<p>For instance, the Haber process (an agricultural process) at equilibrium involves the reaction N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>
--> 2NH<sub>3</sub>. Writing an equilibrium constant for this: </p>

<p>$K_{eq} = Products/Reactants = \frac{[NH_{3}]^{2}}{[N_{2}][H_{2}]^{2}}$</p>

<p>The third and final thing we need to discuss is something called Henry's law. This law states that a 
certain amount of a gas dissolved in a given type of liquid is proportional to the partial pressure
of the gas in equilibrium with the liquid, or:</p>

<p>[Compound in liquid form] = H<sub>compound</sub>[Compound in gas form.]</p>

<p>...where H<sub>compound</sub> is the Henry constant for that compound. You can look up Henry 
constants for compounds on the internet or in a reference book.</p>

<p>A last thing to note, is that when using this, concentrations can be expressed as pressures (more specifically,
partial pressures). To convert to pressures, usually some number ppm means that number x 10<sup>-6</sup> atm, some number ppb means
that number x 10<sup>-9</sup> atm, and some number ppt means that number x 10<sup>-12</sup> atm. It's best to work 
out an example to see what I mean.</p>

<hr />
<p>EXAMPLE: The Henry's law constant for the sulfur dioxide gas is 1.23 M/atm. Consider the average concentration of 
sulfur dioxide in the air to be 5 ppb. Calculate the expected liquid concentration of sulfur dioxide.</p>

<p>We have:</p>
<p>[Compound in liquid form] = H<sub>compound</sub>[Compound in gas form.]</p>
<p>[SO<sub>2 (l)</sub>] = H<sub>SO2</sub>[SO<sub>2 (g)</sub>]</p>
<p>[SO<sub>2 (l)</sub>] = (1.23 atm)[5 ppb]</p>
<p>[SO<sub>2 (l)</sub>] = (1.23 atm)[5 x 10<sup>-9</sup> atm]</p>
<p>[SO<sub>2 (l)</sub>] = 6.2 x 10<sup>-9</sup> M</p>
<hr />

<h2>OCEAN ACIDIFICATION</h2>

<p>First, instead of acid rain, we will use acid deposition, because it's not exactly that the rain suddenly 
becomes this big burning poisonous liquid that destroys everything in its path and comes down catastrophically. 
 Deposition is a better scientific term and is hopefully a less ominous 
one. Still - we begin our study with ocean acidification, which can damage coral reefs and beautiful ecosystems.</p>

<p>We humans (and other organisms) release carbon dioxide into the environment. You may have heard all 
the craze about carbon dioxide being a greenhouse gas. Well, it also helps (indirectly) acidify our oceans,
which is not good for some living creatures under the sea. So we can start with a molecule of carbon dioxide,
and follow it to some water in the air. The carbon dioxide "deposits" on "the water" and we get a weird compound:</p>

<p>$CO_{2 (g)} +H_{2}O_{(l)}$ ⇌ $CO_{2} \cdot H_{2}O_{(aq)}$ (1) (NOTE: $CO_{2} \cdot H_{2}O_{(aq)}$ is also denoted as H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)!</p>

<p>Now, this weird compound-complex-hydrate thingy gets involved with another equilbrium reaction. It 
decomposes into the bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and a hydrogen ion to help acidify 
the ocean (everything from here on out is aqueous):</p>

<p>$CO_{2} \cdot H_{2}O_{(aq)}$ ⇌ $HCO_{3}^{-} + H^{+}$ (2)</p>

<p>The bicarbonate further decomposes into the carbonate ion, throwing a proton to help acidify the ocean:</p> 

<p>$HCO_{3}^{-}$ ⇌ $CO_{3}^{2-} + H^{+}$ (3)</p>

<p>OK. Let's write some equilbirium constants for reactions 1 and 2. Remember: products over reactants. Try it yourself.
When done, compare to these equations.</p>

<p>$K_{1} = \frac{[H^{+}][HCO_{3}^{-}]}{[H_{2}CO_{3}]}$</p>

<p>$K_{2} = \frac{[H^{+}][CO_{3}^{2-}]}{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}$</p>

<p>The total carbon dioxide dissolved turns out to be, after some derivation we will not cover here: </p>

<p>[Total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved] = [H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>] + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]</p>

<p>We may assume that the [H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>] is equivalent to [CO<sub>2 (l)</sub>], so:</p>

<p>[Total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved] = [CO<sub>2 (l)</sub>] + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]</p>

<p>By Henry's Law, </p>

<p>[Total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved] = H<sub>CO2</sub>[CO<sub>2 (g)</sub>] + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]</p>
<p>[Total CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved] = H<sub>CO2</sub>P<sub>CO2</sub> + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]</p>

<p>Now go back to our K1 equation. Isolate the bicarbonate (that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) on one side of the equation.
Now, plug that in into our total carbon dioxide dissolved equation. You should get:</p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] = H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} + \frac{[H_{2}CO_{3}]K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + [CO_{3}^{2-}]$</p>

<p>We already saw how [H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 (aq)</sub>] is equal to [CO<sub>2 (l)</sub>]. So we can use Henry's Law
to get: </p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] = H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + [CO_{3}^{2-}]$</p>

<p>Go to the K<sub>2</sub> equation. Isolate the carbonate on one side. Then plug it back into our total dissolved
carbon dioxide equation. We get: </p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] = H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + \frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]K_{2}}{[H^{+}]}$</p>

<p>Now substitute the $\frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]}$ in for the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration 
and simplify. You should get:</p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] = H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}K_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}$ (A) (!)</p>

<p>Equation (A) is a critical equation. With this, we can measure the [H+] in water and therefore, the pH. 
Unfortunately, this equation obviously requires a calculator, and a powerful one at that to achieve a very
accurate answer. If I know everything except for [H+] (and am trying to solve for that unknown), I usually
use a computer to solve for [H+]. You may want to brush up on your algebra skills if you want to do the calculations by hand.
It is entirely possible to do with a calculator in hand, but it can be a bit boring (and involves having all the fractions
have a common denominator, and, heck, why don't we just try it:</p>

<hr />

<p>EXAMPLE (Are your algebra skills ready to go?)</p>

<p>Solve for [H+] in equation (A)!</p>

<p>So we have this terrifying equation:</p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] = H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}K_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}$ (A)</p>

<p>What did we learn in school? Common denominators! We have to find a common denominator -> [H+]<sup>2</sup> in this 
case. Don't forget when we have it, we HAVE TO multiply the numerators with the number in their respective denominators
as well. Start by moving one term to the other side:</p>

<p>$[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] - H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}} =   \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}K_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}$</p>
	
	
<p>Multiply through by a common denominator:</p>

<p>$\frac{[H^{+}]^{2}[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved] - H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}}{[H^{+}]^{2}} =   \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}[H^{+}]}{[H^{+}]^{2}} + \frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}K_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}$</p>

<p>Simplify:</p>

<p>$[H^{+}]^{2}[Total\:CO_{2}\:dissolved]-H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}=H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}[H^{+}]+H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}K_{2}$</p>

<p>You're still going to probably need a computer/calculator. But at least you can now solve for [H+], you have a quadratic equation.
Hopefully you know how to solve one by hand (but you don't really need to, you can use a computer or something). </p>

<hr />

<p>A MUCH BETTER WAY OF FINDING [H+]</p>

<p>OK, so that wasn't pretty. Fortunately for us, there is an easier way. In actuality, concentrations of 
carbonate, hydroxide anions and other stuff are rather small for the most part, and bicarbonate becomes only the major 
contributor to H+. In fact, it's such a contributor that it usually almost equals the H+ concentration. So we 
make the process a lot simpler by allowing [H+] = [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>].</p>

<p>$[H^{+}]=[HCO_{3}^{-}]=\frac{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}{[H^{+}]}$</p>
<p>$[H^{+}]^{2}=H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}$</p>
<p>$[H+]=\sqrt{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}$</p>
<p>$pH = -log[H+]$</p>
<p>$pH = -log[\sqrt{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}]$ (B)</p>

<p>This is way better than the junk we did previously. Equation (B) is the much prettier form of Equation (A) 
under the assumption that bicarbonate is the main ion playing a part in the acidity balance, which it usually
is. This equation is much nicer and more convenient than (A), and I like this one. It doesn't always work - 
but it usually does under some right assumptions.</p>

<hr />
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<p>Calculate the pH of rainwater if the mixing ratio of carbon dioxide is 400 ppm (which it is, as of 2016). 
Henry's constant for carbon dioxide is 0.034 M/atm, K<sub>1</sub> is 4.3 x 10<sup>-7</sup> M.</p>

<p>$pH = -log[\sqrt{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}]$</p>

<p>$pH = -log[\sqrt{(0.034\:M/atm)(400\cdot10^{-6} atm)(4.3\cdot10^{7} M)}]$</p>

<p>$pH = 5.6$</p>

<p>You can clearly see natural rainwater is already acidic (even though you don't feel burns when it splashes on you)</p>

<p>Calculate the pH of rainwater if the mixing ratio of carbon dioxide is 800 ppm (double our current atmospheric carbon dioxide levels!). 
Henry's constant for carbon dioxide is 0.034 M/atm, K<sub>1</sub> is 4.3 x 10<sup>-7</sup> M.</p>

<p>$pH = -log[\sqrt{H_{CO_{2}}P_{CO_{2}}K_{1}}]$</p>

<p>$pH = -log[\sqrt{(0.034\:M/atm)(800\cdot10^{-6} atm)(4.3\cdot10^{7} M)}]$</p>

<p>$pH = 5.5$</p>

<p>Hopefully this won't kill you. Still, even slight pH changes can affect the organisms around us.</p>


<hr />

<h2>SULFUR & COAL</h2>

<p>I have been debating to myself whether to cover detailed calculations regarding sulfur. When it comes to sulfur playing 
a role in acid rain, calculating the pH is much more complicated because in these areas you often have
a lot of contributing factors that could interfere: ammonium, nitrate, etc...so I will just cover 
the main reactions which contribute to sulfuric acid rain. Know that these are not the only reactions
which mess up with the rainwater's pH. Nevertheless, sulfur dioxide gas is a BIG contributor to 
acid rain, and is perhaps one of the most important compounds that make our rain too acidic. 
Suflur dioxide comes from volcanoes, coal plants, smelters, diesel vehicles and some natural environments/organisms
that produce hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide. So let's start. </p>

<hr />

<p>Some time ago, there was acid rain damaging natural environments.. There still is. But when the 
damage occured years ago, people became angry and scientists got curious. What rain could be killing 
the forests? </p>

<p>Although there are many things that could affect a rainwater's pH, scientists looked toward
sulfur dioxide. At first, it was thought that sulfur dioxide reacted with the OH radical to 
form HOSO<sub>2</sub>, where all players are a gas. The newly formed HOSO<sub>2</sub> reacts
with molecular oxygen to form HO<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub> . The SO<sub>3</sub> then 
reacts with liquid water to form liquid sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). In general,</p>

<ul>
<li>OH + SO<sub>2</sub>--> HOSO<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>HOSO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> HO<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> --> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 (l)</sub></li>
</ul>


<p>But...</p>

<p>This mechanism was way too slow and didn't seem favorable. So they crossed this out, and kept thinking.
It turns out the proper reaction mechanism was:</p>

<ul>
<li>SO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3 (l)</sub> (sulfurous acid)</li>
<li>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3 (l)</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (bisulfite)</li>
<li>HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + O<sub>3</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (sulfate ion) + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> + liquid water</li> 
<li>Some free sulfate ions and hydrogen ions form aqueous sulfuric acid during this mechanism</li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that this is the mechanism for sulfuric acid rain. Again, 
this is complicated because ozone is involved, and we already saw how everything
interferes with ozone in the tropospheric section. There also could be 
reactions which lower the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Not only that, some sources of ions,
like calcium from calcium carbonate (in limestone) act as buffers that can reduce
the acidity. The above mechanism alone could be investigated for a long time; just 
know this is the main mechanism of sulfuric acid rain.</p>

<p>So, what about acid rain involving nitrogen? The main reaction which forms nitric acid that 
can lower pH of rainwater is one you already learned about in the tropospheric section. It's
OH + NO<sub>2</sub> --> HNO<sub>3</sub>. (Some sources of NOx also come from lightning, bacteria and biomass).
You can have nitric acid rain, you can have sulfuric acid rain. Take your pick...</p>

<hr />
<p>EXPLORATION: (1) Research acid fog. Read some material about it. (2) Research buffers for acid rain. What 
are some good ones? (3) Research ocean acidification/coral reef acidity. What did you find out? Do you 
think clownfish or sea anenomes could go endagered?</p>
