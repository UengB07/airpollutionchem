<h1>PRESSURE PROFILE OF THE ATMOSPHERE</h1>

<p>Please take your time to look at the picture below.</p>

<div id="basis">

<p>Follow the turquoise (torquouise? turquiouse? anyway, the dark kind-of-looks-blue) line which starts from 0 degrees Celsius and goes all the way to the left axis. This is the general picture of how pressure decreases in the atmosphere. For our purposes,
we use millibars (mb) and atmospheres (atm) for our discussions. Note that 1 atmosphere of pressure = 1013.25 millibars.</p>

<p>Pressure decreases exponentially as we go up. It only takes 10 km of the atmosphere to reach quite a low pressure. As you go up, pressure doesn't vary that much. The most variation of pressure 
happens in the troposphere. This also implies most molecules are found in the troposphere. Lighter gases can travel 
more efficiently to the upper atmosphere, and only the lightest gases, such as hydrogen, escape.</p>

<p>We haven't created an accurate mathematical formula that can discuss the pressure change in the entire atmosphere, but it turns out we can derive an approximate equation, called
the barometric law:</p>

$P_{z} = P_{0}e^{-\frac{z}{H}}$

<p>where P<sub>z</sub> is the pressure at the altitude z, P<sub>0</sub> is the pressure at the surface, 
usually taken to be 1 atm or 1013.25 mb, z is the height, and H is what we call the scale height, which 
depends on temperature. Different books have different references for the "average" scale height. 
For our purposes, we will use a value of 8 kilometers. (You may see some scale heights 0.5 km below 
or above this value in different texts). This formula certainly does not work everywhere, but it is 
usually a good approximation. Be also sure you know how to use the e button on your calculator. </p>

<hr />

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<p>Calculate the air pressure at 3 kilometers. The answer may not be exact, but it is a useful approximation.</p>

<p>$P_{z} = P_{0}e^{-\frac{z}{H}}$</p>

<p>$P_{z} = (1\:atm)e^{-(\frac{3 km}{8 km})}$</p>

<p>$P_{z} = 0.7\:atm$</p>

<p>The answer is about 0.7 atm. Hope your head does not get dizzy at this altitude. You can see the advanced section for a derivation of the
formula. Keep in mind that the advanced section is for people who know calculus and general physics.</p>
