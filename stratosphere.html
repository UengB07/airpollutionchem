<h1>STRATOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY</h1>

<h2>FUN WITH RATES</h2>

<p>The stratosphere is an important topic of study due to the presence of ozone, which helps protect us (and 
other creatures) from ultraviolet radiation. </p>

<p>We begin our study with the Chapman reactions, which was mentioned in the temperature profile section in
prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li>O<sub>2</sub> + light --> O + O (1)</li>
<li>O + O<sub>2</sub> + M --> O<sub>3</sub> + M* (2)</li>
<li>O<sub>3</sub> + light --> O + O<sub>2 </sub>(3)</li>
<li>O + O<sub>3</sub> --> 2O<sub>2 </sub>(4)</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, reaction (2) is the main reaction which causes heating in the stratosphere. The "M", which is usually
either molecular oxygen or nitrogen, obtains energy from the single O atom and oxygen molecule, and the 
general reaction leads to warming of the stratosphere. Perhaps we could do something similar to what we did 
with the tropospheric page - make a steady state assumption, set two rates equal to each other, and solve
for an ozone concentration in the stratosphere. So let's give it a shot.</p>

<p>First, we need to know some rate laws. The corresponding rate laws for each reaction are below:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) $Rate_{rxn\:1}=k_{1}[O_{2}]$</li>
<li>(2) $Rate_{rxn\:2}=k_{2}[O][O_{2}][M]$</li>
<li>(3) $Rate_{rxn\:3}=k_{3}[O_{3}]$</li>
<li>(4) $Rate_{rxn\:4}=k_{4}[O][O_{3}]$</li>
</ul>

<p>We can make a steady-state assumption that the rate of destruction of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) 
is the he same of the rate of formation of molecular oxygen. Reaction (1) destroys oxygen, and reaction (4)
generates oxygen. So rate of reaction (1) = rate of reaction (4) or: </p>

<p>$k_{1}[O_{2}] = k_{4}[O][O_{3}]$ (5)</p>


<p>Another thing we can assume is the rate of destruction of ozone is the same as the rate of formation 
of ozone. Reaction (3)'s mechanism terminates ozone while reaction (2) creates ozone. Set the rates 
equal to each other:</p>

<p>$k_{2}[O][O_{2}][M] = k_{3}[O_{3}]$ (6)</p>

<p>From (6), we can also solve individually for the single oxygen atom concentration (isolate [O] on the left side):</p>

$[O]=\frac{k_{3}[O_{3}]}{k_{2}[O_{2}][M]}$ (7)

<p>Plug (7) into the [O] in (5) and do move around some numbers:</p> 

<p>$k_{1}[O_{2}] = k_{4}[O][O_{3}]$ (5)</p>

<p>$k_{1}[O_{2}] = k_{4}\left(\frac{k_{3}[O_{3}]}{k_{2}[O_{2}][M]}\right)[O_{3}]$</p>

<p>$k_{1}[O_{2}] = k_{4}\left(\frac{k_{3}[O_{3}]^{2}}{k_{2}[O_{2}][M]}\right)$</p>

<p>$[O_{3}] = \frac{k_{1}k_{2}[O_{2}]^{2}[M]}{k_{4}k_{3}}$ (8)</p> 

<p>So there's our equation (8) to calculate ozone concentration in the stratosphere!</p>

<p>Too bad it's WRONG.</p>

<p>Why is this? First, there is somewhat of an overestimation of some of the rate constants of the light 
reactions. But this isn't really as big of a deal as the fact that we cannot calculate ozone using the formulas
we have constructed. This is because ozone is being lost! Our steady state
formulas don't work! Something is not accounted for. And of course, we don't want ozone to disappear in
the stratosphere - otherwise harmful ultraviolet will penetrate through and cause damage to humans. So, now the question is:
what is the loss process for ozone? Why does ozone disappear in the stratosphere? And this is where we talk about
the....</p>

<h2>CATALYTIC CYCLES (the bulk and meat of this page)</h2>

<p>We must investigate the destroyers of ozone in the stratosphere. Take a look at the image below. I know what you are 
thinking.</p>

<p>WHAT IN #@&%*()#&%(#*&#(*&!!! IS THIS?</p>

</div>

<div id="gallery">

<img src="images/stratosphere.png" /> 

</div>

<div id="basis">

<p>Let's go slowly to figure out what's going on, and let's look at each of these in depth.</p>

<h3>Chlorine</h3>

</div>

<div id="gallery">

<img src="images/stratosphere1.png" /> 

</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>Some years ago, two scientists by the (last) names of Stolarski and Cicerone proposed that chlorine played 
a role in stratospheric chemistry. They proposed that chlorine interefered with ozone (and "destroyed" it). Indeed, 
chlorine actually reacts with ozone to form ClO (chlorine monoxide) and molecular oxygen. Also, 
two scientists by the (last) names of Rowland and Molina proposed that chlorofluorocarbon gases (CFCs) 
contained the chlorine necessary to initiate the ozone destruction. Let's start to investigate.</p>

<p>Start with the CFC in the green box. The CFC is released from the surface, which is in the troposphere, 
and is not very active with other compounds. So it just stays the way it is, and enters the stratosphere. 
Interaction with energetic sun rays (more abundant in the stratosphere) are able to break off a chlorine 
from the CFC here. The chlorine then reacts with ozone to create chlorine monoxide and molecular oxygen.
So there's that ozone gone. Now, let's pay attention to the newly formed chlorine monoxide. Look at the 
ClO in the green circle. This can go two ways - it can react with nitrogen dioxide or with the single O atom.
Note that the interaction with the O atom regenerates more chlorine, which can further destroy ozone. The only
main pathway chlorine can be destroyed is by interacting with methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), with generates hydrochloric acid (HCl). Even 
then, the hydrochloric acid can react with the OH radical to regenerate chlorine. One might see already that 
chlorine is not easy to get rid of, as there are a few reactions which favor this destroyer of ozone.</p>
 
 
<p>Let us investigate further with the cyan dotted line in the figure at the top. We see that chlorine monoxide
generates reacts with nitrogen dioxide to generate ClONO<sub>2</sub>, which can photolyze to revert back to 
ClO. In general, the formation of 
ClONO<sub>2</sub> helps deactivate chlorine, reducing ozone destruction.
 But...something more interesting happens here - ClONO<sub>2</sub> can undergo another pathway.</p>

<p>Now in the stratosphere, there are clouds which form called polar stratospheric clouds. These are quite cold - they can 
have a temperature of less than -78 degrees Celsius (-108 degrees Farenheit)! It turns out, the following can 
happen: the HCl and ClONO<sub>2</sub> react each other on the polar stratospheric cloud's surface:</p>

<div id="gallery">

<img src="images/PSC.png" /> 

</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>It turns out both HCl and ClONO<sub>2</sub> may deposit on the ice at the polar stratospheric cloud, and
then a ClONO<sub>2</sub> and HCl undergo a reaction which separates the chlorine atoms fromn the rest of the 
compounds. Molecular chlorine is formed, and nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) is generated. (*The nitric acid 
generally just stays on the PSC ice and doesn't go flying far away from it). Meanwhile, the molecular chlorine
can undergo photolysis, and then the bond holding the chlorine atoms together break. More chlorine radicals 
are generated, which can destroy even more ozone. So hopefully you can see there's quite a few pathways 
for the reformation of chlorine - and the further destruction of ozone.</p>

<p>But we're not done yet (unfortunately) with the methods of chlorine to destroy ozone. It turns out, ClO
molecules can react with each other in a process called dimerization. The reaction is this: 
ClO + ClO + M --> Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + M. The newly formed Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can 
react with light to form 2 chlorine atoms and an oxygen molecule. In other words,</p>

<ul>
<li>ClO + ClO + M --> Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + M* </li>
<li>Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + light --> 2 Cl + O<sub>2</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that these reactions, combined with the Cl + O<sub>3</sub> --> ClO + O<sub>2</sub> step, generates
a net reaction of 2O<sub>3</sub> --> 3O<sub>2</sub>. So the ozone gets destroyed - it transfers into 
molecular oxygen. So we can see when ozone in the stratosphere is getting destroyed, molecular oxygen is 
generated - but this molecular oxygen doesn't really help us much with protecting from harmful, ultraviolet rays.
We need that ozone to be protected.</p>

<p>A word about lifetimes:</p>

<p>Chlorine's lifetime can be that of less than a second, while ClO's lifetime 
is usually a few minutes. So they are quite reactive - and then begins the ozone destruction. Formulas for 
the lifetimes of Cl and ClO in the stratospheric area of interest are as follows:</p>

<p>$\tau_{Cl} = \frac{1}{k_{chlorine + ozone}[Ozone]}$ (!!)</p>

<p>$\tau_{ClO} = \frac{1}{k_{O + ClO}[O]}$</p>

<p>We explore one last thing. We can define the chain length of being 
a number which stands for the efficiency of production or destruction of something. The chain length is 
generally defined as the rate of propagation over the rate of termination. In our case, the rate of 
propagation is k<sub>O+ClO</sub>[O][ClO] and the rate of termination is k<sub>methane + Cl</sub>[Cl][CH<sub>4</sub>].
So: </p>

<p>$Chain\:Length = \frac{Rate\:of\:Propagation}{Rate\:of\:Termination}$ (!!)</p>

<p>$Chain\:Length = \frac{k_{O+ClO}[O][ClO]}{k_{methane + Cl}[Cl][CH_{4}]}$ (!)</p>

<p>It turns out that the chain length for this process was found to be approximately 20,000. This is very 
efficient for destroying ozone.</p>

<h3>Bromine</h3>

</div>

<div id="gallery">
<img src="images/stratosphere2.png" />
</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>Bromine is a compound that undergoes almost similar reactions. A bromine containing compound (usually a halon)
travels to the stratosphere; once there, gets its bond broken by light, and now a bromine atom roams freely
until it interacts with ozone, yielding a BrO atom and an oxygen molecule. BrO usually reacts with O to revert
to bromine, but it can also react with nitrogen dioxide to form BrONO<sub>2</sub>, which can then undergo 
photolysis to revert back to BrO. Bromine is terminated mainly NOT by methane, but rather, our lovely 
hydroperoxyl radical (HO<sub>2</sub>) to from hydrogen bromide. HBr then deposits somewhere. As usual, 
ozone gets eaten up by something - in this case, bromine. There is no major regeneration of ozone.</p>

<h3>Flourine?</h3>

<p>If you are in chemistry, you should know or learn that in the periodic table, elements in the same group should exhibit the same 
reactive properties (in general). So we covered bromine, we covered chlorine, and ah! - what about flourine? It's 
in the same group as the other two. Would it be a good eater of ozone?</p>

<p>It is not.</p>

<p>Why? This is because flourine reacts with methane about 1,000 times more rapidly than 
it does with chlorine! So it terminates quite quickly - it prefers "eating" methane over ozone. Indeed, 
it seems that the reaction of F + CH<sub>4</sub> --> HF + CH<sub>3</sub> is so much more favorable than 
the F + O<sub>3</sub> --> FO + O<sub>2</sub> reaction. Try it yourself - calculate the enthalpies of reaction you
learned from the Some More Chemistry page in the prerequisites section. You will see that flourine likes methane better.
Also, the chain length of the flourine cycle is almost about 10 - compare that with 20,000 to the chlorine cycle. </p>

<hr />

<p>EXPLORATION:</p>

<p>It seems that the reaction of F + CH<sub>4</sub> --> HF + CH<sub>3</sub> is so much more favorable than the F + O<sub>3</sub> --> FO + O<sub>2</sub> reaction. Try it yourself - calculate the enthalpies of these reactions. You learned the process from Some More Chemistry page in the prerequisites section.
You can do the same for the bromine reaction with ozone, the hydroperoxyl radical, and methane (for methane, you should see that the reaction is not favorable).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Nitric Oxide</h3>


</div>

<div id="gallery">
<img src="images/stratosphere3.png" />
</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>Some years ago (yes, I know I use this phrase quite a bit), a person named Paul Crutzen proposed that nitric oxide 
could be interefering with stratospheric chemistry (or playing a role, for better terms). Indeed, he was right. 
A compound called nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) can come from agricultural activity and the soils (some also 
comes from industrial processes). This nitrous oxide can react with a single oxygen atom to form 2 NO molecules. 
The NO molecule can then react with ozone (starting to see a pattern on termination of ozone?) and create 
nitrogen dioxide and molecular oxygen. So again, a poor ozone is eaten up. The nitrogen dioxide can react with the
OH radical to form nitric acid, but at the same time, nitric acid can undergo photolysis to generate nitrogen 
dixoide again. Nitrogen dixoide finally reacts with O to form NO.</p>

<h3>Hydroxyl Radical</h3>

</div>

<div id="gallery">
<img src="images/stratosphere4.png" />
</div>

<div id="basis">
<p>The hydroxyl radical was a key player in tropospheric chemistry. And now it's coming to the stratosphere! 
Turns out, methane can react with an O atom to generate OH radicals in the stratosphere. Once there,
it's business as usual, it reacts with ozone to generate oxygen and a hydroperoxyl radical. The hydroperoxyl
radical may react with nitrogen dioxide to form a somewhat unusual compound. Anyway, you will see a weird
HO-2-NO2 next to each other and some weird letters "hv". Pay no attention to this area - just know that 
hydroperoxyl radicals here could react with nitrogen dioxide. It is more important to focus on how OH gets 
terminated. OH + nitrogen dioxide will yield nitric acid. This is more complicated than the others, but 
the key is that OH can eat up ozone. It's not as intense as chlorine, and the reactions may be a bit weird in 
this cycle, but OH is an ozone destroyer. It can be a bit of an odd but significant process nonetheless.</p>

<h3>A COMMON THEME</h3>
<p>Now! Let's go back to the picture back near the "CATALYTIC CYCLES (the bulk and meat of this page)" title. 
Pay attention to the purple dotted areas in the picture. They all have one thing in common. What do we mean by this?
Let's write down reactions which occur in the purple dotted section.</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Cl + O<sub>3</sub> --> ClO + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>+ClO + O --> Cl + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>__________________________________</li>
<li>O + O<sub>3</sub> --> 2O<sub>2</sub> (SUM)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Br + O<sub>3</sub> --> BrO + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>+BrO + O --> Br + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>__________________________________</li>
<li>O + O<sub>3</sub> --> 2O<sub>2</sub> (SUM)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;NO + O<sub>3</sub> --> NOO + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>+NOO + O --> NO + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>__________________________________</li>
<li>O + O<sub>3</sub> --> 2O<sub>2</sub> (SUM)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;OH + O<sub>3</sub> --> HO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>+HO<sub>2</sub> + O --> OH + O<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>__________________________________</li>
<li color="red">O + O<sub>3</sub> --> 2O<sub>2</sub> (SUM)</li>

<li>Sums are all the same reaction!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>In all these, you get something that interacts then comes back. Chlorine enters the reaction with ozone,
and then emerges out at the end. Bromine enters the reaction with ozone, and then emerges out at the end.
Nitric oxide enters...you get the idea. The point is, the sum or the net reaction is the same for all 
of the cases! One ozone should get destroyed. But as we will see later, at high latitudes, (near the poles), 
these reactions don't work very well - there is insufficient energy to form O atoms from the 
Chapman reactions.</p>

<p>And just like the tropospheric section, there's another catch. Let's say we increase the amount of NO in
the stratosphere. Then it should destroy ozone right? But let's go back to part (1) with all the chlorine. 
Remember, we said the reaction Cl + NO<sub>2</sub> --> ClONO<sub>2</sub> generally hinders ozone destruction. 
Note that nitrogen dioxide is in this equation. Increasing NO means increasing nitrogen dioxide, hence a
decrease in ozone destruction at the chlorine cycle. But an ozone is still being destroyed in the NO cycle.
It turns out that actually increasing NO can reduce ozone destruction in the chlorine cycle (considering 
the polar stratospheric cloud reactions aren't super abundant and generate a lot of chlorine atoms). We have 
to remember that all parts interact, and nature is complex. In general, chlorine in the stratosphere is 
the #1 thing we should focus efforts on.</p>


<h2>THE OZONE HOLE</h2>

<p>At high latitudes, the catalytic reactions we said don't work because there isn't enough energy 
to break oxygen atoms and generate single O atoms, which are needed for these reactions to work. 
<u>It is the dimerization process mentioned in the chlorine section which allows the formation of single 
chlorine atoms and destruction of ozone (go back to the chlorine section to remind yourself).</u> Note 
that O atoms are not required in this dimerization process. The breaking of ClO doesn't require 
as much energy. Combine this with polar the reactions we discussed in polar stratospheric clouds, which 
grow quite active during inside a phenomenon called the polar vortex (which usually happens at the poles, mind
you). The reactions in the PSCs as well as dimerization yields a deadly combination of ozone destruction. Many
Cl atoms get generated and eat up ozone. Suddenly, the ozone near the stratospheric portion of the pole drops, 
and an ozone hole forms. Meterological/climatological conditions lead to the hole forming during certain times of 
the year because of polar vortexes, ClO building up, and the existence of polar stratospheric clouds.</p>

<p>Like tropospheric chemistry, stratospheric chemistry is a complex and varied field. There's a lot going on -
more than what we discussed on this page. But these are the fundamentals - or so I hope But -<u>MAIN POINT:
the main pathway of ozone destruction in Antarctica is ClO dimerization, along with the meterological 
conditions (polar vortex and polar stratospheric clouds). ClO comes mostly from chlorine which humans 
emit (i.e. CFCs).</u></p>

<p>EXPLORATION - NASA has a page called Ozone Watch. Go ahead and explore it, and find out what (1) a Dobson
unit is, (2) read NASA's explaination of the ozone hole and when it forms, and (3) what it looks like 
on different days/times of year. Why do you think it's a much bigger deal in the Antarctic vs. the Arctic?
Also, research the polar vortex. </p>
