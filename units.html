<h1>UNITS (and other math stuff you need to know)</h1>

<hr />

<h2>SCIENTIFIC NOTATION AND PREFIXES</h2>

<p>To start off, I presume you already know how to do some basic operations such as multiplication and division. 
The next thing we need to know are units and prefixes. In basic math classes, you usually don't need units for most 
problems - what you get is usually unitless. However, in the real world, you have to use units, otherwise who
will know what you are talking about? For instance, if your answer is five, people will be asking "five what? Five 
sheep? Five apples? Five movies? Five rockets that launch into outer space to attack against aliens?"</p>

<p>So point one: It is important to label your units. Put a word after you write down the number to let 
everyone know what you're talking about. It's very helpful!</p>

<p>Second, it is important to know scientific notation. This is usually expressed as a 10 with a tiny number on 
the upper right hand side, known as a superscript.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Scientific notation</th>
    <th>Full number displayed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>12</sup></td>
    <td>1000000000000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>9</sup></td>
    <td>1000000000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>6</sup></td>
    <td>1000000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>3</sup></td>
    <td>1000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>1</sup></td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-1</sup></td>
    <td>0.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-2</sup></td>
    <td>0.01</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-6</sup></td>
    <td>0.000001</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-9</sup></td>
    <td>0.000000001</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You should see something going on here, the number the superscript says - that is the number of zeroes after the
number one if positive, and the number of zeros before the one if the superscript is negative. You should get used 
this notation - it will help you greatly in your life (I hope).</p> 

<hr />

<p>Example: Write 10<sup>-4</sup> in full. How do you write 10000 in scientific notation?</p>

<p>Answer: 0.0001. Remember, there are four zeros before the one and the superscript is negative. 10<sup>4</sup> for
the second question. Four zeroes after the one.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, our next topic is to learn prefixes. These are useful in the realm of science. You have your unit, and you 
simply insert your prefix in front. Let us explore a little more:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Scientific notation</th>
    <th>Prefix</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>12</sup></td>
    <td>-tera...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>9</sup></td>
    <td>-giga...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>6</sup></td>
    <td>-mega...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>3</sup></td>
    <td>-kilo...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-1</sup></td>
    <td>-deci...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-2</sup></td>
    <td>-centi...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-3</sup></td>
    <td>-milli...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-6</sup></td>
    <td>-micro...unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="unitright">10<sup>-9</sup></td>
    <td>-nano...unit</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So if you had 10<sup>-6</sup> grams of pollutants, that would be one microgram. If you had 10<sup>9</sup>
seconds to do your homework, that would be one gigasecond (which is very, very long. Maybe your homework would be 
due in about 31 or 32 years if this actually happened?). It would be useful to play around with your prefixes 
and scientific notation and to get good at knowing how to work it. This can be a useful skill for life.</p>

<h2>DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>Before starting this section, make sure you have a calculator, preferably scientific or graphing, or a calculator 
on your computer. Be sure you know how to use it or you have a manual on how to perform calculations.</p>

<p>We will need to be proficient at converting units if we are to fully understand how to work with air pollutants.
See the drawing below to learn about the "factor-label" method (also called the "chain-link") method:</p>

<p>Now let's work out an example. How many seconds are there in seventeen days?</p>

<p>$(17\:days)\left(\frac{24\:hours}{1\:day}\right)\left(\frac{60\:minutes}{1\:hour}\right)\left(\frac{60\:seconds}{1\:minute}\right) =\:?$</p>

<p>When work it out, you should get 1,468,800 seconds.</p>

<p>Alright, let's have a try again. How many feet are there in 5 centimeters? 1 meter is approximately equal to 3.28 feet.</p>

<p>$(5\:cm)\left(\frac{1\:m}{100\:cm}\right)\left(\frac{3.28\:feet}{1\:m}\right) =\:?$</p>

<p>The answer is 0.164 feet. Now let's move on to rates.</p>

<p>Let us say there is a bathroom facuet that has a sink flow rate of 1.2 gallons per minute. Convert this to 
liters per second.</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{1.2\:gallon}{1\:minute}\right)\left(\frac{3.785\:L}{1\:gallon}\right)\left(\frac{1\:minute}{60\:s}\right) =\:?$</p>

<p>The answer is about 0.076 liters per second.</p>

<p>Before proceeding on, it is useful to look up on the internet "Dimensional Anaylsis" and to do several problem
associated on other sites if you are still not feeling comfortable. Dimensional anaylsis is a critical skill which
one will need to understand certain material on this site.</p>
